    There are two functions in scripts.js:
    1. authenticate()
    2. signup()
    Both functions take two arguments username and password.
    authenticate() returns true if the username and password are correct. It returns false if they are wrong.
    signup() returns true if the username is not reserved and successfully signed up. It returns false if it is reserved by another user.
